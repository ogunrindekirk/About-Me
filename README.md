# About Me
My name is Kirk Ogunrinde and I am a juniour at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. I am double-majoring in Computer Science and Journalism, and want to become a newsroom developer. I am looking to use my skills in newsroom to create and manage publishing tools to help power journalism. From stories to audio, video, photos and more, the demand for newsroom software is growing everyday, and it is important to not that these products are used by nearly every single reporter and editor in the newsroom. I am proficient in both backend and frontend development tools, including C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and React.
